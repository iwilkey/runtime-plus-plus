# Runtime++

Runtime++ is a fast, efficient, easy-to-use, and open-source C++ interactive application framework. It is intended for the fast creation of reactive and reliable applications such as 2D/3D video games, general software applications, or any other reasonable "creative coding" endeavors. It offers support of well-known and powerful tools such as x, and the CMake build system offers fast and easy multiplatform compilation for Windows/OSX/Linux.

## Built for Creative Coders

Runtime++ is a catch-all framework for any application that is intended to run in its window and context. Built on the sturdy foundation of the Simple DirectMedia Layer, Runtime++ allows access to a cross-platform hardware abstraction layer for computer multimedia hardware components. 

With access to easy-to-use Runtime++ abstracted tools such as OpenGL and Dear Imgui, the stage is set for the creation of any interactive software you can think of. The list grows as features are added, but as of now, you may consider using Runtime++ for projects such as...

    * Simple or complex 2D/3D video games
    * GUI utilities for completing tasks such as installation, file management, or networking.
    * Video editing software
    * Audio editing software
    * Animation software
    * Server-side or client-side GUI applications
    * GUI hardware monitoring
    * Chat rooms or other social media
    * Video or audio streaming
    * Text editing software
    * Internet explorers
    * Much, much more: Anything you can think of!

## How to Use

Ready to jump in? All you need to do is follow the instructions below to start writing your first Runtime++ application. Because this project relies on many external dependencies, some setup is required. Do not worry, it is built to be simple so this part should (hopefully) not take too long.

## Building

To play your Runtime++ project, you must first build it and then invoke the executable created.

The Runtime++ build system fundamentally utilizes CMake.
